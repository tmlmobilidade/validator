### Field Definitions

|Field Name|Type|Presence|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|`route_id`|Foreign ID referencing `routes.route_id`|Required|Identifies a route.|
|`service_id`|Foreign ID referencing `calendar.service_id` or `calendar_dates.service_id`|Required|Identifies a set of dates when service is available for one or more routes.|
|`trip_id`|Unique ID|Required|Identifies a trip.|
|`trip_headsign`|Text|Optional|Text that appears on signage identifying the trip's destination to riders.<br>This field is recommended for all services with headsign text displayed on the vehicle which may be used to distinguish amongst trips in a route.<br><br>If the headsign changes during a trip, values for `trip_headsign` may be overridden by defining values in `stop_times.stop_headsign` for specific `stop_times` along the trip.|
|`trip_short_name`|Text|Optional|Public facing text used to identify the trip to riders, for instance, to identify train numbers for commuter rail trips.<br>If riders do not commonly rely on trip names, `trip_short_name` should be empty.<br><br>A `trip_short_name` value, if provided, should uniquely identify a trip within a service day; it should not be used for destination names or limited/express designations.|
|`direction_id`|Enum|Optional|Indicates the direction of travel for a trip. This field should not be used in routing; it provides a way to separate trips by direction when publishing time tables.<br><br>Valid options are:<br>`0` - Travel in one direction (e.g. outbound travel).<br>`1` - Travel in the opposite direction (e.g. inbound travel).<br><br>Example: The `trip_headsign` and `direction_id` fields may be used together to assign a name to travel in each direction for a set of trips. A `trips.txt` file could contain these records for use in time tables:  `trip_id`,...,`trip_headsign`,`direction_id`  1234,...,Airport,0  1505,...,Downtown,1|
|`block_id`|ID|Optional|Identifies the block to which the trip belongs. A block consists of a single trip or many sequential trips made using the same vehicle, defined by shared service days and `block_id.` A `block_id` may have trips with different service days, making distinct blocks.<br><br>See the example below. To provide in-seat transfers information, transfers of `transfer_type` 4 should be provided instead.|
|`shape_id`|Foreign ID referencing `shapes.shape_id`|Conditionally Required|Identifies a geospatial shape describing the vehicle travel path for a trip.<br><br>**Conditionally Required**:<ul><li>Required if the trip has a continuous pickup or drop-off behavior defined either in `routes.txt` or in `stop_times.txt`.</li><li>Optional otherwise.</li></ul>|
|`wheelchair_accessible`|Enum|Optional|Indicates wheelchair accessibility. <br><br>Valid options are:<br>`0` or empty - No accessibility information for the trip.<br>`1` - Vehicle being used on this particular trip can accommodate at least one rider in a wheelchair.<br>`2` - No riders in wheelchairs can be accommodated on this trip.|
|`bikes_allowed`|Enum|Optional|Indicates whether bikes are allowed.<br><br>Valid options are:<br>`0` or empty - No bike information for the trip.<br>`1` - Vehicle being used on this particular trip can accommodate at least one bicycle.<br>`2` - No bicycles are allowed on this trip.|

**Notes on above table**:

- On Friday into Saturday morning, for example, a single vehicle operates trip_1, trip_2, and trip_3 (10:00 PM through 12:55 AM). Note that the last trip occurs on Saturday, 12:00 AM to 12:55 AM, but is part of the Friday “service day” because the times are 24:00:00 to 24:55:00.
- On Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, a single vehicle operates trip_1, trip_4, and trip_5 in a block from 8:00 PM to 10:55 PM.
