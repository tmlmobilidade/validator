# Attributes

  - File: [shapes.txt]
  - Field: shape_pt_sequence
  - Presence: Required
  - Type: Non-negative integer

# Description

Sequence in which the shape points connect to form the shape.

Values must increase along the trip but do not need to be consecutive.

# Example

If the shape "A_shp" has three points in its definition, the [shapes.txt] file might contain these records to define the shape:

	shape_id,shape_pt_lat,shape_pt_lon,shape_pt_sequence
	A_shp,37.61956,-122.48161,0
	A_shp,37.64430,-122.41070,6
	A_shp,37.65863,-122.30839,11
